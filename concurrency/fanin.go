// FanIn pattern combines multiply inputs into one single output channel.

// to combine all the workersâ€™ outputs to be processed as a single unified stream.

// FanIn is implemented as a function that receives N source channels. For each
// input channel FanIn starts a separate goroutine to read values from its assigned channel and
// forward all the values to a single destination channel shared by all the goroutines.
